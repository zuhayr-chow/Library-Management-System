# Library-Management-System
A full-stack Flask application that helps librarians manage borrowing, reservations, fines, and book reviews using both SQL and NoSQL. MySQL was used for relational data (Books, Members), and MongoDB was integrated for storing flexible review data. The system includes CRUD operations, reporting features, and a clean UI.
