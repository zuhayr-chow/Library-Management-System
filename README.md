# 📚 Library Management System (Hybrid SQL + NoSQL Project)

## 🔍 About This Project

This is a full-stack library management system built as a semester-long academic project.  
It allows librarians to manage books, members, borrowing, returns, fines, and analytics — all through a Flask-based web application with a clean sidebar interface.

It uses **MySQL** for core relational data (Books, Members, Borrowing, etc.) and **MongoDB** to handle flexible user-generated content like **book reviews** — showcasing a hybrid database design.
